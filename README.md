# Chess50
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/QW3ZiED2QSU
#### Description:
This is Chess50, my final project of the CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science course. It is a web-based mini-clone application of the popular website chess.com. The front-end is mainly made with HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript for interactivity. The back-end is a combination of Python and JavaScript as well as Flask as the framework and SQLite for databases.

Features include:
- playing chess against an engine (Stockfish 15.1) with take-back moves, engine moves on demand and flipping the board,
- solving chess.com's Daily Puzzle,
- keeping track of the leaderboards for the most popular time controls,
- and searching for valid chess.com usernames to get their profile information and game statistics.

### Engine
Includes two versions of the chess engine Stockfish 15.1, one slower than the other. I could not tell a defference between the two and chose the slower one as I deemed it good enough.

### static

#### css

### templates
Includes the html templates. I decided on making a layout template for the overarching structure of the website where all the other templates would be called.

#### layout.html
