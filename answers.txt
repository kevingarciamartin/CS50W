The averages are avg_energy = 0.66, avg_valence = 0.48 and avg_danceability = 0.72. According to these numbers I would characterize the audio aura

The calculation only takes into consideration three aspects of a song. A direct improvement would be to at least take the average for all parameters
that characterizes a song.
