Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The runtime does not increase linearly with the number of simulations. For small number of simluations (N <= 1000) the runtime is approximately equal.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations, while still being relatively fast enough.
